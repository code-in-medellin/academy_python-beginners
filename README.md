How to use this series of notebooks ? Each notebook is divided into three part, the last one being exercises and examples. You will also find what I call *experiences*, they are very simple example you can try and do as an exercise. If you want more exercises and examples you can check out [hackerrank.com](hackerrank.com), a great website for self-taught programmers.
